    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate valid random **undirected weighted graphs** as adjacency matrices\n",
    "* Compute MSTs with two different algorithms and verify they match in weight\n",
    "* Design timing experiments that are fair, repeatable, and interpretable\n",
    "* Present results professionally: tables/plots + clear discussion + limitations\n",
    "\n",

    "## What you are given\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the `MST` class exactly as shown in codebase below. Use it as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** the class accepts *any* diagonal sentinel for “no edge” (commonly `0`), and treats that same value elsewhere as “no edge” as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write test code to generate graphs (adjacency matrices)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that generates **symmetric square matrices** representing **undirected graphs** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **non-negative integer weights**\n",
    "* **no self-loops** (all diagonal entries must be the no-edge sentinel)\n",
    "* **symmetry** (`G[i][j] == G[j][i]`)\n",
    "* a **configurable density** (sparse vs dense), or at minimum a consistent rule for whether an edge exists\n",
    "* a consistent **no-edge sentinel** (use `0` unless you want to be adventurous)\n",

    "**Deliverable:**\n",
    "`make_graph(n: int, density: float, max_w: int, seed: int) -> list[list[int]]`\n",

    "(If you don’t want to use `density`, you can design your own parameterization—but you must still produce a range of “more edges” vs “fewer edges” graphs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 2) For each generated graph, compute MSTs using *both* techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test graph `G`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an `MST(G)` object\n",
    "2. Compute `T_b = mst.boruvka()`\n",
    "3. Compute `T_k = mst.kruskal()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then verify correctness in a way that actually means something. A good minimum bar:\n",

    "* Compute total weight of `T_b` and `T_k`\n",

    "* A correctness check that raises an error if weights differ\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Time the techniques for various graph sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "You must collect timing data for a range of `n` values. Pick a sequence that makes sense given that Borůvka here is ~O(n⁴). These are just examples below. Consider more/different sizes to showcase your testing/experimenting attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50` (safer)\n",
    "* or `n = 25, 50, 75, 100` (spicier; might hurt)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each `n`, run **multiple trials** (minimum 5; better 10+ if it’s not too slow). Use the same input graph for both algorithms in each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing rules (read this twice):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don’t time graph generation together with MST computation unless you clearly separate it.\n",
    "* Use a high-resolution timer (ok to import `time`)\n",
    "* Keep everything else constant (same machine, same settings).\n",
    "* Report **mean** and **standard deviation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A results table with at least: `n`, `trials`, `avg_boruvka`, `avg_kruskal`, plus variability\n",
    "* At least one plot showing runtime vs `n` (two curves)\n",

    "Write a short report (300-600 words) that includes:\n",

    "1. **Experimental setup**\n",

    "   * How does density affect each method (if you varied density)?\n",

    "   * Python overhead, caching effects, small n weirdness, etc.\n",

    "# Experimental setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs were generated using .2 density value and 1-100 weight range. Connectedness was validated by creating a spanning tree within the graph to connect separate components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The n values selected were 25, 50, 75, 100. 20 trials of both Boruvka and Kruskal’s algorithm were performed for each n value. The timer used was the Python time library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "Generated by above notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "Observed growth closely resembles expected complexity. By performing an adequate number of trials, in my case 20, the generated graph easily reflects the Big-O running time of both Boruvka and Kruskal. Both algorithms run in polynomial time, and Boruvka shows O^4 growth, while Kruskal shows O^2 growth. While Boruvka’s algorithm was able to run in a reasonable amount of time on my machine, as n number of vertices grows exponentially Boruvka’s algorithm can easily become unwieldly and impractical to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "Using a small number of n nodes may lead to inconsistent results when generating the graph. Also calculating the running time of the graph in a notebook locally on my computer may lead to inconsistent results. For example, running time results on my computer will differ from someone who runs my notebook on different hardware. Also, differences in Python versions and environments used lead to further variability that make it even more difficult to reproduce results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency matrix representations are impractical for Kruskal’s algorithm due to the size of adjacency matrices and the speed to retrieve edges from adjacency matrices. Kruskal’s algorithm is dependent on listing edges, no matter the graph’s density. Since the space complexity of adjacency matrices is always O(V^2), this can lead to unnecessary space used to run Kruskal’s algorithm. Also, retrieving sorted edge lists used for Kruskal’s algorithm is slow using adjacency matrices. In order to retrieve an edge list from an adjacency matrix, it is necessary to traverse all vertices in the matrix and retrieve all edges that exist. Using an alternative implementation such as an adjacency list will make edge retrieval much faster (O(E)). With these limitations in mind, the adjacency matrix implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm may lead to additional overhead where the running time is not reflective of real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "I learned that the choice of algorithms is important to minimize the running time of graph algorithms. The theoretical running time of Boruvka and Kruskal’s algorithms, O^4 and O^2, is reflected in the practical results table and graph that I have generated using these algorithms. Choosing the most efficient algorithm when creating my code is necessary so that I can minimize running time as I increase the scale that my code is used in.\n"
