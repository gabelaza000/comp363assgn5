    "The n values selected were 25, 50, 75, 100. 20 trials of both Boruvka and Kruskal’s algorithm were performed for each n value. The timer used was the Python time library.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "Generated by above notebook cells.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "Observed growth closely resembles expected complexity. By performing an adequate number of trials, in my case 20, the generated graph easily reflects the Big-O running time of both Boruvka and Kruskal. Both algorithms run in polynomial time, and Boruvka shows O^4 growth, while Kruskal shows O^2 growth. While Boruvka’s algorithm was able to run in a reasonable amount of time on my machine, as n number of vertices grows exponentially Boruvka’s algorithm can easily become unwieldly and impractical to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "Using a small number of n nodes may lead to inconsistent results when generating the graph. Also calculating the running time of the graph in a notebook locally on my computer may lead to inconsistent results. For example, running time results on my computer will differ from someone who runs my notebook on different hardware. Also, differences in Python versions and environments used lead to further variability that make it even more difficult to reproduce results.\n",

    "Adjacency matrix representations are impractical for Kruskal’s algorithm due to the size of adjacency matrices and the speed to retrieve edges from adjacency matrices. Kruskal’s algorithm is dependent on listing edges, no matter the graph’s density. Since the space complexity of adjacency matrices is always O(V^2), this can lead to unnecessary space used to run Kruskal’s algorithm. Also, retrieving sorted edge lists used for Kruskal’s algorithm is slow using adjacency matrices. In order to retrieve an edge list from an adjacency matrix, it is necessary to traverse all vertices in the matrix and retrieve all edges that exist. Using an alternative implementation such as an adjacency list will make edge retrieval much faster (O(E)). With these limitations in mind, the adjacency matrix implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm may lead to additional overhead where the running time is not reflective of real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "I learned that the choice of algorithms is important to minimize the running time of graph algorithms. The theoretical running time of Boruvka and Kruskal’s algorithms, O^4 and O^2, is reflected in the practical results table and graph that I have generated using these algorithms. Choosing the most efficient algorithm when creating my code is necessary so that I can minimize running time as I increase the scale that my code is used in.\n"
